  abstract = {Web Application Firewalls (WAF) have evolved to protect web applications from attack. A signature-based WAF responds to threats through the implementation of application-specific rules which block malicious traffic. However, these rules must be continually adapted to address evolving threats. The resultant rules can become complex and difficult to maintain, requiring that the administrator possesses a high-level of skills and detailed knowledge of the application. Not to mention the challenges of zero-day attacks! A WAF can deliver high rates of false positives and false negatives that can adversely impact the performance and can provide poor protection against zero-day attacks. This paper aims to provide a short review showing the development of WAFs based on machine-learning-based methods. It discusses their merits and limitations as well as identifying open issues. It assesses which of them can provide countermeasures to zero-day attacks and are easy to configure and maintain to keep them up to date. It was found that machine-learning-based methods have advantages over signature/rule-based methods as the former can address the vulnerability to zero-day attacks and can be easier to configure and keep up to date. The survey also determined that the effectiveness of machine-learning-based WAFs in protecting current attack patterns targeting web application frameworks is still an open area for further investigation.},

  abstract = {Considering the increasing deployment of the Internet and information systems together with providing various services through web applications, the related risks and threats in this field are also skyrocketing. In recent years several different websites such as online shops, portals, and governmental sites were subject to penetrations attacks and illegal hacking activities. The mentioned intrusions have often resulted in significant financial and credibility losses together with endangering organizational and even national interests. Given the magnitude and complexity of cyber-attacks and due to the diversity of the web application's structure, the need to have a comprehensive and effective solution to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of such attacks is imperative. Taking into account the nature of the Internet and the necessity of websites availability 24 hours a day from all parts of the globe, it is ideal and can be taken as an advantage, but it should be also noted that this feature, considering the absence of appropriate security, can lead to some main ways for targeting and attacking web applications. One of the newest tools to prevent infiltration and attacks on websites, are web application-specific firewalls or the Web Application Firewalls (WAF) by which security policies can be applied among end users and web applications. In this paper this feature has been implemented in software for protection and provides the advantage of preserving the security in web applications against attacks and methods which affect the system together through a comparative approach.},

  abstract = {Web applications of all kinds, whether online shops or partner portals, have in recent years increasingly become the target of hacker attacks. The attackers are using methods which are specifically aimed at exploiting potential weak spots in the web application software itself – and this is why they are not detected, or are not detected with sufficient accuracy, by traditional IT security systems such as network firewalls or IDS/IPS systems. OWASP develops tools and best practices to support developers, project managers and security testers in the development and operation of secure web applications. Additional protection against attacks, in particular for already productive web applications, is offered by what is still a emerging category of IT security systems, known as Web Application Firewalls (hereinafter referred to simply as WAF), often also called Web Application Shields or Web Application Security Filters.},

Due to dramatic increase in Web applications, security gets vulnerable to variety of threats. Most of these attacks are targeted towards the web application layer and network firewall alone cannot prevent these kinds of attacks. The basic reason behind success of these attacks is the ignorance of application developers while writing the web applications and the vulnerabilities in the existing technologies. Web application attacks are the latest trend and hackers are trying to exploit the web application using different techniques. Various solutions are available as open source and in commercial market. But the selection of suitable solution for the security of the organizational systems is a major issue. This survey paper compared the Web Application Firewall (WAF) solutions with important features necessary for the security at application layer. Critical analysis on WAF solutions is helpful for the users to select the most suitable solution to their environments.},

Correspondingly, the rapid development of the web relies on the continuous development of Internet infrastructure such as hardware and application software and related protocols. However, with the rapid development of Web applications, the security situation is not optimistic. Most Web applications have security vulnerabilities, and traditional network security devices have limited protection against attacks at the application layer. A traditional firewall can only protect the network layer. IDS and IPS cannot effectively protect against application layer attacks through flexible coding and packet segmentation. Therefore, this paper analyzes HTTP protocol and mainstream Web attacks and their bypass methods. Aiming at the shortcomings of HTTP protocol and pattern matching, this paper proposes a Web application firewall system based on feature matching. Experiments show that the Web application firewall system can defend against various web application layer attacks and effectively solve the omission problem of Web attack detection.},
